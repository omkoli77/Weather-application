## 🧠 Use of LLMs (Mandatory Requirement)

This project was developed with assistance from **GPT-5 (LLM)** at multiple steps:

| Task | How LLM Helped |
|------|----------------|
| Understanding API responses | Helped decode JSON fields from OpenWeatherMap |
| UI approach | Guided how to organize state and display components |
| Error handling | Provided logic to manage invalid city names |
| Documentation | README text and explanation structured with LLM assistance |

> The LLM served as a **planning and guidance assistant**, but all implementation and coding were done by me.
